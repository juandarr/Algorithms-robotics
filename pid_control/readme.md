# PID control implementation in Python

This repository includes different implementations of P, PD, PI and PID controller in Python. A robot vehicle has an initial position and orientation. We expect to control
the steering angle of the vehicle so that it can follow a predefined trajectory while minimizing the error between the current vehicle position and the position where it is expected
to be , given by the trajectory.
